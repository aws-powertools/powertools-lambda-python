A suite of utilities for AWS Lambda Functions that makes tracing with AWS X-Ray, structured logging and creating custom metrics asynchronously easier.

* **Status**: Release candidate
* **How long until GA?**: [Current progress](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools/projects/1)
* **Docs**: [Main docs](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/) | [API Docs](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/api/)

## Features

* **[Tracing](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/core/tracer/)** - Decorators and utilities to trace Lambda function handlers, and both synchronous and asynchronous functions
* **[Logging](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/core/logger/)** - Structured logging made easier, and decorator to enrich structured logging with key Lambda context details
* **[Metrics](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/core/metrics/)** - Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)
* **[Bring your own middleware](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/utilities/middleware_factory/)** - Decorator factory to create your own middleware to run logic before, and after each Lambda invocation

### Installation
