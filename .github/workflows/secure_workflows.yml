name: Lockdown untrusted workflows

# PROCESS
#
# 1. Scans for any external GitHub Action being used without version pinning (@<commit-sha> vs @v3)
# 2. Scans for insecure practices for inline bash scripts (shellcheck)
# 3. Fail CI and prevent PRs to be merged if any malpractice is found

# USAGE
#
# Always triggered on new PR, PR changes and PR merge.
