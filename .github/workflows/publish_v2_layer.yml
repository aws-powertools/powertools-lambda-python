name: Deploy v2 layer to all regions

# PROCESS
#
# 1. Compile Layer using cdk-aws-lambda-powertools-layer CDK construct for x86 and ARM (uses custom runner as it's CPU heavy)
# 2. Kick off pipeline for beta, prod, and canary releases
# 3. Create PR to update trunk so staged docs also point to the latest Layer ARN, when merged
# 4. Builds and publishes docs with latest Layer ARN using given version (generally coming from release)

  # Updating the documentation with the latest Layer ARNs is a two-phase process
  #
  # 1. Update layer ARNs with latest deployed locally and create a PR with these changes
  # 2. Pull from temporary branch with these changes and update the docs we're releasing
  #
  # This keeps our permissions tight and we don't run into a conflict,
  # where a new release creates a new doc (2.16.0) while layers are still pointing to 2.15
  # because the PR has to be merged while release process is running
