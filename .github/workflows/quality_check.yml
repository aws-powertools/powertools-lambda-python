name: Code quality

# PROCESS
#
# 1. Install all dependencies and spin off containers for all supported Python versions
# 2. Run code formatters and linters (various checks) for code standard
# 3. Run static typing checker for potential bugs
# 4. Run entire test suite for regressions except end-to-end (unit, functional, performance)
# 5. Run static analysis (in addition to CodeQL) for common insecure code practices
# 6. Run complexity baseline to avoid error-prone bugs and keep maintenance lower
# 7. Collect and report on test coverage

# USAGE
#
# Always triggered on new PRs, PR changes and PR merge.
