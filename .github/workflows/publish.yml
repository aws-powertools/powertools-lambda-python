name: Publish to PyPi

# RELEASE PROCESS
#
# === Manual activities ===
#
# 1. Document human readable changes in CHANGELOG (pre-generate unreleased changes with `make changelog`)
# 2. Bump package version using poetry version <major|minor|patch|specific version>
# 3. Merge version changes to develop branch
# 4. Edit the current draft release notes
# 5. If not already set, use `v<new version>` as a tag, and select develop as target branch
#
# === Automated activities ===
#
# 1. Extract release notes tag that was published
# 2. Ensure release notes tag match what's in CHANGELOG and pyproject
# 3. Run tests, linting, security and complexity base line
# 4. Publish package to PyPi test repository
# 5. Publish package to PyPi prod repository
# 6. Kick off Lambda Layer pipeline to publish latest version with minimal dependencies as a SAR App
# 7. Kick off Lambda Layer pipeline to publish latest version with extra dependencies as a SAR App
# 8. Builds a fresh version of docs including Changelog updates
# 9. Push latest release source code to master using release title as the commit message
# 10. Builds latest documentation for new release, and update latest alias pointing to the new release tag
# 11. Close and notify all issues labeled "status/staged-next-release" about the release details

#
# === Fallback mechanism due to external failures ===
#
# 1. Trigger "Publish to PyPi" workflow manually: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow
# 2. Use the version released under Releases e.g. v1.13.0
#

#
# === Documentation hotfix ===
#
# Look for rebuild latest docs workflow
