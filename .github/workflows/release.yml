# RELEASE PROCESS
#
# === Automated activities ===
#
# 1.  [Seal] Bump to release version and export source code with integrity hash
# 2.  [Quality check] Restore sealed source code, run tests, linting, security and complexity base line
# 3.  [Build] Restore sealed source code, create and export hashed build artifact for PyPi release (wheel, tarball)
# 4.  [Provenance] Generates provenance for build, signs attestation with GitHub OIDC claims to confirm it came from this release pipeline, commit, org, repo, branch, hash, etc.
# 5.  [Release] Restore built artifact, and publish package to PyPi prod repository
# 6.  [Create Tag] Restore sealed source code, create a new git tag using released version, uploads provenance to latest draft release
# 7.  [PR to bump version] Restore sealed source code, and create a PR to update trunk with latest released project metadata
# 8.  [Publish Layer] Compile Layer and kick off pipeline for beta, prod, and canary releases
# 9.  [Publish Layer] Update docs with latest Layer ARNs and Changelog
# 10. [Publish Layer] Create PR to update trunk so staged docs also point to the latest Layer ARN, when merged
# 12. [Post release] Close all issues labeled "pending-release" and notify customers about the release
#
# === Manual activities ===
#
# 1. Kick off this workflow with the intended version
# 2. Update draft release notes after this workflow completes
# 3. If not already set, use `v<new version>` as a tag, e.g., v1.26.4, and select develop as target branch

# NOTE
#
# See MAINTAINERS.md "Releasing a new version" for release mechanisms
#
# Every job is isolated and starts a new fresh container.
