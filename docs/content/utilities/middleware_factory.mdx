import Note from "../../src/components/Note"

Middleware factory provides a decorator factory to create your own middleware to run logic before, and after each Lambda invocation synchronously.

**Key features**

* Run logic before, after, and handle exceptions
* Trace each middleware when requested

## Middleware with no params

You can create your own middleware using `lambda_handler_decorator`. The decorator factory expects 3 arguments in your function signature:

* **handler** - Lambda function handler
* **event** - Lambda function invocation event
* **context** - Lambda function context object

```python:title=app.py
from aws_lambda_powertools.middleware_factory import lambda_handler_decorator

# highlight-start
@lambda_handler_decorator
def middleware_before_after(handler, event, context): 
# highlight-end
    # logic_before_handler_execution()
    response = handler(event, context)
    # logic_after_handler_execution()
    return response

@middleware_before_after # highlight-line
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ...
```

## Middleware with params

You can also have your own keyword arguments after the mandatory arguments.

```python:title=app.py
@lambda_handler_decorator
def obfuscate_sensitive_data(handler, event, context, fields: List = None): # highlight-line
    # Obfuscate email before calling Lambda handler
    if fields:
        for field in fields:
            field = event.get(field, "")
            if field in event:
                event[field] = obfuscate(field)

    return handler(event, context)

@obfuscate_sensitive_data(fields=["email"]) # highlight-line
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ...
```

## Tracing middleware execution

If you are making use of [Tracer](../core/tracer), you can trace the execution of your middleware to ease operations.

This makes use of an existing Tracer instance that you may have initialized anywhere in your code.

```python:title=trace_middleware_execution.py
from aws_lambda_powertools.middleware_factory import lambda_handler_decorator

@lambda_handler_decorator(trace_execution=True) # highlight-line
def my_middleware(handler, event, context):
    return handler(event, context)

@my_middleware
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ...
```

When executed, your middleware name will [appear in AWS X-Ray Trace details as](../core/tracer) `## middleware_name`.

For advanced use cases, you can instantiate [Tracer](../core/tracer) inside your middleware, and add annotations as well as metadata for additional operational insights.

```python:title=app.py
from aws_lambda_powertools.middleware_factory import lambda_handler_decorator
from aws_lambda_powertools.tracing import Tracer

@lambda_handler_decorator(trace_execution=True)
def middleware_name(handler, event, context):
    # highlight-start
    tracer = Tracer() # Takes a copy of an existing tracer instance
    tracer.add_annotation...
    tracer.add_metadata...
    # highlight-end
    return handler(event, context)
```

## Tips

* Use `trace_execution` to quickly understand the performance impact of your middlewares, and reduce or merge tasks when necessary
* When nesting multiple middlewares, always return the handler with event and context, or response
* Keep in mind [Python decorators execution order](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/#nesting-decorators). Lambda handler is actually called once (top-down)
* Async middlewares are not supported

## Testing your code

When unit testing middlewares with `trace_execution` option enabled, use `POWERTOOLS_TRACE_DISABLED` env var to safely disable Tracer.

```bash:title=pytest_disable_tracing.sh
POWERTOOLS_TRACE_DISABLED=1 python -m pytest
```
