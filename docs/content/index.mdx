Powertools is a suite of utilities for AWS Lambda Functions that makes tracing with AWS X-Ray, structured logging and creating custom metrics asynchronously easier.

## Install

Powertools is available in PyPi. You can use your favourite dependency management tool to install it

* [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/): `poetry add aws-lambda-powertools`
* [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html): `pip install aws-lambda-powertools`

## Features

* [Tracing](./core/tracer) - Decorators and utilities to trace Lambda function handlers, and both synchronous and asynchronous functions
* [Logging](./core/logger) - Structured logging made easier, and decorator to enrich structured logging with key Lambda context details
* [Metrics](./core/metrics) - Custom Metrics created asynchronously via CloudWatch Embedded Metric Format (EMF)
* [Bring your own middleware](./utilities/middleware_factory) - Decorator factory to create your own middleware to run logic before, and after each Lambda invocation
* [Parameters utility](./utilities/parameters) - Retrieve parameter values from AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, AWS Secrets Manager, or Amazon DynamoDB, and cache them for a specific amount of time

## Tenets

* **AWS Lambda only** – We optimise for AWS Lambda function environments and supported runtimes only. Utilities might work with web frameworks and non-Lambda environments, though they are not officially supported.
* **Eases the adoption of best practices** – The main priority of the utilities is to facilitate best practices adoption, as defined in the AWS Well-Architected Serverless Lens; all other functionality is optional.
* **Keep it lean** – Additional dependencies are carefully considered for security and ease of maintenance, and prevent negatively impacting startup time.
* **We strive for backwards compatibility** – New features and changes should keep backwards compatibility. If a breaking change cannot be avoided, the deprecation and migration process should be clearly defined.
* **We work backwards from the community** – We aim to strike a balance of what would work best for 80% of customers. Emerging practices are considered and discussed via Requests for Comment (RFCs)
* **Idiomatic** – Utilities follow programming language idioms and language-specific best practices.

_`*` Core utilities are Tracer, Logger and Metrics. Optional utilities may vary across languages._

## Environment variables

**Environment variables** used across suite of utilities.

Environment variable | Description | Utility
------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------
**POWERTOOLS_SERVICE_NAME** | Sets service name used for tracing namespace, metrics dimension and structured logging | all
**POWERTOOLS_METRICS_NAMESPACE** | Sets namespace used for metrics | [Metrics](./core/metrics)
**POWERTOOLS_TRACE_DISABLED** | Disables tracing | [Tracing](./core/tracer)
**POWERTOOLS_TRACE_MIDDLEWARES** | Creates sub-segment for each custom middleware | [middleware_factory](./utilities/middleware_factory)
**POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_LOG_EVENT** | Logs incoming event | [Logging](./core/logger)
**POWERTOOLS_LOGGER_SAMPLE_RATE** | Debug log sampling | [Logging](./core/logger)
**LOG_LEVEL** | Sets logging level | [Logging](./core/logger)

## Debug mode

As a best practice, AWS Lambda Powertools logging statements are suppressed. If necessary, you can enable debugging using `set_package_logger`:

```python:title=app.py
from aws_lambda_powertools.logging.logger import set_package_logger

set_package_logger()
```
## Lambda Layer

Powertools is also available as a layer and is distributed via the [Serverless Application Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo/latest/devguide/what-is-serverlessrepo.html).
Create the layer via API with:

```bash:title=bash-script
aws serverlessrepo create-cloud-formation-change-set --application-id arn:aws:serverlessrepo:eu-west-1:057560766410:applications/aws-lambda-powertools-python-layer --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME --capabilities CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM
CHANGE_SET_ID=$(aws cloudformation list-change-sets --stack-name YOUR_STACK_NAME --query 'Summaries[*].ChangeSetId' --output text)
aws cloudformation wait change-set-create-complete --change-set-name $CHANGE_SET_ID
aws cloudformation execute-change-set --change-set-name $CHANGE_SET_ID
```

this will create a CloudFormation stack with the powertools layer in a specific region where you run this commands.
Keep in mind that layers are regional resources and you need to create the layer in every region where you need it.
Alternatively, you can deploy the layer from the AWS Console by navigating to Serverless Application Repository and search for `aws-lambda-powertools-python-layer` and follow the deploy steps from there.
